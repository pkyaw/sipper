{"Name":"Facebook Pop","Id":1540,"Alias":"Facebook.Pop","Description":"Pop is an open-source animation engine behind the Facebook Paper\u0027s smooth animations and transitions. Using dynamic instead of traditional static animations, Pop drives the scrolling, bouncing, and unfolding effects that bring Paper to life.\n\n\n## Need for Pop\nSince the original iPhone, iOS has excelled at supporting static animations. The Apple-provided Core Animation framework makes linear, ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-ease-out animations simple to leverage.\n\nThe innovation of touch interfaces has ushered in a new wave of software design. Direct manipulation of on-screen elements has removed one level of indirection, which in turn has raised our expectations for the screen as a medium. If objects respond to our touches, they should also respond to the velocity of our flick.\n\nThe vision of Pop is to be a solution that will evoke the same delightful experience of UIScrollView throughout the whole application. Pop is the latest manifestation of that vision, allowing us to keep the familiar and powerful programming model of Core Animation while also capturing a gesture’s velocity and better reflecting user intent. \n\n\n## Open source\nYou can learn more about Pop on GitHub: https://github.com/facebook/pop\n","Version":"1.0.7","Summary":"An extensible iOS and OS X animation library, useful for physics-based interactions.","QuickStart":"Pop aims to offer utility on three different axes. First, to make commonly needed animations extremely convenient. In addition to the four established static animations, Pop introduces three new primitive animation types: \n\n - Spring\n - Decay\n - Custom\n\n\n*Spring* and *decay* are dynamic animations that help bring your apps to life. *Spring* gives elements their attractive bounce. *Decay* brings movement to an eventual slow halt. Both take velocity as an input and are good candidates for realistically responding to user gestures.\n\nPop was designed to be an extensible framework. Custom animation allows developers to plug in their own animation code, making it easier to create unique effects.  Pop can animate any property of any Objective-C object.\n\nPop was constructed with a developer-friendly yet powerful programming model.  It uses the Core Animation interface for starting and stopping animations.  Most notably, it also supports querying running animations – which is key for interrupting animations and building fluid interfaces. \n\nThe fundamental animation type is a `POPAnimation`.  The following code snippet showcases how to animate the bounds of a layer using a spring:\n\n```csharp\nvar a = POPSpringAnimation.AnimationWithPropertyNamed (POPAnimation.LayerBounds) {\n    ToValue = NSValue.FromCGRect (new CGRect (0, 0, 400, 400))\n};\n\nlayer.AddAnimation (a, \"size\");\n```\n\n\nIf you know how to use Core Animation explicit animations, you know how to use Pop.\n\n\n## Learn More\nTo learn more about Pop, visit the official open-source repository: https://github.com/facebook/pop\n","Hash":"57633c7fb6a7db5ee8df5261d5a99e56","TargetPlatforms":["ios"],"TrialHash":null}
