Pop is an open-source animation engine behind the Facebook Paper's smooth animations and transitions. Using dynamic instead of traditional static animations, Pop drives the scrolling, bouncing, and unfolding effects that bring Paper to life.


## Need for Pop
Since the original iPhone, iOS has excelled at supporting static animations. The Apple-provided Core Animation framework makes linear, ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-ease-out animations simple to leverage.

The innovation of touch interfaces has ushered in a new wave of software design. Direct manipulation of on-screen elements has removed one level of indirection, which in turn has raised our expectations for the screen as a medium. If objects respond to our touches, they should also respond to the velocity of our flick.

The vision of Pop is to be a solution that will evoke the same delightful experience of UIScrollView throughout the whole application. Pop is the latest manifestation of that vision, allowing us to keep the familiar and powerful programming model of Core Animation while also capturing a gestureâ€™s velocity and better reflecting user intent.
